Welcome to Zulip setup! You will need:
- An email address for support and error emails, like ops@example.com. You can change
  this email address later.
- A hostname for the Zulip server, like chat.example.com. The hostname must be a valid
  domain with DNS configured to point to the IP address of this droplet.

Press Ctrl+C to exit setup for now. You will be prompted again on your next login.

Press Enter to continue.
